### ðŸš€ 1. **TIME-DILATED AGENT FARM**

> **Simulate decades of decision-making in minutes.**

- Agents run thousands of simulations of a product, life path, or startup decision tree
- Each iteration learns from the last (like generational genetic drift)
- Time inside agent space runs faster than real time
- You get _2045-level results_ in _15 minutes_

**Use for:**

- Startup strategy
- Personal decision optimization
- Philosophical simulations ("What if Nietzsche was a DAO founder?")
