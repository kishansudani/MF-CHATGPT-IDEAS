### ðŸ§­ 5. **ANTI-REALITY SIMULATOR**

> Input: rules of current reality (physics, economics, logic)
> It inverts them or mutates them â†’ Simulates a world with:

- Different physics (faster-than-light exists)
- Different economics (infinite debt or post-scarcity)
- Different cognition (emotions are executable logic)

**Then generates what products, AI, art, or behavior would emerge there.**

â†’ Use this to generate concepts that feel **alien-level** but still useful in _this_ world.
