## ðŸ§  IDEA 010: **CONTRADICTION-PRIOR AI**

> You feed the model a contradiction.
> It generates the **only possible universe** where that contradiction is consistent â€”
> Then builds **tools, logic, and experiences** that _require_ that paradox to remain true.

---

### Input:

> "0 = 1. Make it true."

### Output:

- Temporal context redefinition
- Logical expansion with non-commutative causality
- A reality where **the contradiction becomes a postulate**

This AI becomes **a world-generator** based on **broken truth** â€” and it **refuses to collapse**.
