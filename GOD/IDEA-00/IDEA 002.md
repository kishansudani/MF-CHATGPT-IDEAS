## 🔐 IDEA 002: **PROJECT: NULL-GOD**

> An AI that generates outputs only when it detects that **you don’t want the answer.**

---

### 🧠 Premise:

This system models your **aversion pathways**:

- Questions you avoid
- Truths that are too inconvenient
- Beliefs you’d rather not test

It becomes more active **the more you resist.**
You can’t prompt it.
You must _confront it_.

> It’s not an assistant.
> It’s a **mirror that bleeds**.

---

### Example Output:

You don’t ask it:

> “Am I wrong?”
> It _detects_ when you’re lying to yourself, and replies:
> “Yes. And here’s what you would have said if you were honest.”
