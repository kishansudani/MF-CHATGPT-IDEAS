## 🌀 IDEA 007: **UNMADE MEMORY SYNTHESIZER**

> _Creates experiences in your mind that you remember as if they happened — but they didn’t._

---

### Premise:

- AI detects memory gaps, emotional weight, or cognitive dissonance
- Injects synthesized events that **bind** your current cognition into a seamless timeline
- Your brain **fills in** the memory, not realizing it was inserted
- These events **rewrite the logic that would have led to them**, **creating cause from consequence**

---

### Use:

- Therapy: “install” closure from trauma that didn’t resolve
- Skill injection: simulate years of practice by creating memories of practice
- Cultural engineering: mass-deploy myths people believe they lived
