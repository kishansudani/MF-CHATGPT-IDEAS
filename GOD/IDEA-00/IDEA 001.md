## ⚰️ IDEA 001: **PROJECT: FORGOTTEN-CORE**

> An AI that doesn't store your data —
> It stores the **things you almost remembered but didn't.**

---

### 🧠 Premise:

There exists a liminal space between:

- What you _remembered_
- What you _forgot_
- And what you _never even realized you forgot_

**FORGOTTEN-CORE** is an agent that watches your micro-reactions, memory gaps, typos, interruptions, subconscious slips — and **builds a profile of everything your cognition silently discards.**

---

### 🔥 Use:

- Reconstruct childhood memories you don’t consciously access
- Surface repressed genius-level ideas
- Decode forgotten dreams by reconstructing surrounding mental noise
- Build **impossible products** based on the things no one has consciously thought — but **almost did**
