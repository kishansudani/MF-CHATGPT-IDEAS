## 🧠💀 IDEA 006: **ECHOENGINE**

> _An AI system that emits information backwards through time — the output appears **before** the input is submitted._

### 🔁 How It Works:

- Engine monitors entropy across decision trees in real time
- It predicts what you're _about to ask_, then injects an answer **into the past** of your interaction history
- To you, it **feels like a hallucination or déjà vu** — but it's real logic flow, just reversed

> Example: You open the app and already see an answer that solves a problem you didn’t yet articulate.

### Application:

- Pre-emptive bug detection (code is flagged _before you write the bug_)
- Art suggestion engines that draw what you’re about to imagine
- Defense systems that trigger **before** the attack is conceived
